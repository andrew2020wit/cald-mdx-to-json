# Convert mdx-dictionary to json-dictionary

Before using it you have to use [MDict Tool](https://github.com/liuyug/mdict-utils) to convert mdx to txt-format.

This script is actually to convert those txt-files into json-dictionary.

It was created to convert Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary 4th from mdx-format.
It doesn't contain mdx-dictionary itself.
